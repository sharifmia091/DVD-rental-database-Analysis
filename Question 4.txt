Question 4
We would like to know who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments
they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments. 
Can you write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, 
and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers?
