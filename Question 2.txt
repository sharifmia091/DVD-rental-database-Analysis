Question 2
Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares
to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and
divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based 
on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories?
Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.**/
